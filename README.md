### Problem Statement :-

>*Eyes is one of the important facial structure in our body, without eyes we can't see this beautiful world. It's our responsiblity to take care of that. If we don't blink our eyes 10-15 times/minute while using PC or laptops then it gets dry. Our project focus on these issue and help them to take care of that. Sometime you want to focus on studies but your strain doesn't allow it. We can show them their eyes behaviour timeline with a linked website with desktop application which can store the history of the blinks, so that users can check it and improve accordingly. After logged in to the website they can see their details as per data sent by the application.*
